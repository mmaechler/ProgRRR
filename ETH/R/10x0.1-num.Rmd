R Markdown:  "Why 10 * 0.1 is rarely 1.0"
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button in RStudio, a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

Why "10 * 0.1 is rarely 1.0"
============================
The above is a citation of one of the early books in computer science,
[The Elements of Programming Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Programming_Style) by Kernighan and Plauger, 1974, where it was the title of section 36 (of 56).

Actually, it `10 * 0.1` *is* `1.0` on most platforms in today's R, typically:
```{r}
10 * 0.1 == 1.0
```
Still, as you will hopefully come to see, it is rather *lucky coincidence*, because we will see that `0.1` is not exactly the same as the mathematical $1/10$.
A similar computation is
```{r}
0.3 + 0.6 == 0.9
```
and this is indeed, not true.
Let's explore some of the numbers in R:
```{r}
x1 <- seq(0, 1, by = 0.1)
(x2 <- 0:10 / 10)
```
So far, nothing special. Both `x1` and `x2` are the
the same, 0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0,  right ?
```{r}
x1 == x2
```
Oops, what happened?
```{r}
n <- 0:10
rbind(x1 * 10 == n,
      x2 * 10 == n)
```

So it seems, that `x2` is exact, but `x1` is not?
Not true:
```{r}
(d2  <- diff(x2))
unique(d2)
```
Aha...  So, one `0.1` differs from some other `0.1` ??
Is R computing nonsense?

No.  The computer can only compute with finite precision, **and** it uses _binary_ representations of all the "numeric" (_double_) numbers.
```{r}
print(x2, digits=17)
```


On one hand, we learned that $(a + b) - a = b$ or similarly $(a/b) \times b = a$,
or  $\frac a n + \frac b n = \frac{a+b}{n}$
in high school -- or earlier.
As you can see from above, this is not always true in computer arithmetic:
```{r}
1/10  + 2/10 ==  3/10
```
Why? ... ...
Well if they are not equal, let's look at the difference
```{r}
1/10  + 2/10  - 3/10
```
Aha... So what happened above?
```{r}
(u2 <- unique(d2))
u2 * 10
u2 - 1/10
```

**Note**: Among all the (shortened) fractions $m / n$,
only very few are exact in (usual) computer arithmetic:
The denominator $n$ must be of the form $n = 2^k, k \in \{0,1,\dots\}$,
e.g.  1/2,  3/4,  13/16,   but not 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, 4/10 !

### **Take away:**

1. Do not use '==' for numbers unless they are integer**
   (or otherwise *known* to be exact)
2. Compare (vectors of) numbers with `all.equal()`
```{r}
all.equal(x1, x2)
all.equal(x1, x2, tol = 1e-10)
all.equal(x1, x2, tol = 1e-15)
all.equal(x1, x2, tol = 0) ## -> shows the *relative* difference
```

3. Sometimes, instead of `all.equal`, you use `abs(x - y) < 1e-10` (absolute error)
   or often more reasonably
```{r}
abs(x1 - x2) <= 1e-10 * abs((x1 + x2)/2)
```
and you may note that `<=` is important and not the same as `<`.

4. The (in principle platform dependent, today mostly the same (64-bit arch)
   Maschine constants in R -- also contain the "computer epsilon"
   $\epsilon_C := \max_\epsilon 1+\epsilon = 1$  where "$+$" and "$=$"
   really computer arithmetic operations, not mathematical ones.
```{r}
str(.Machine) # str() using itself only 3 (significant) digits:
2^-52   # double.eps : the computer epsilon
2^-1022 # double.xmin
2^1023.9999
```

---

### After thought:
```{r}
ni <- 1:20
cbind(n = ni, "1/n + 2/n - 3/n" = sapply(ni, function(n) 1/n + 2/n - 3/n))
##... R get's it right more often than not ..
n <- 500 # or 1500, 5000 ..
ni <- 1:n ; not.eq <- sapply(ni, function(n) (1/n + 2/n - 3/n) != 0)
ni[not.eq] ## hmm... do we see a pattern ?

plot(ni[not.eq])
grid()
plot(diff(ni[not.eq]))
plot(diff(ni[not.eq]), type = "o")
acf (diff(ni[not.eq])) # .. weak pattern .. not clear
acf (sqrt(diff(ni[not.eq]) - 1)) # .. not clear
```
